# Hello, Textract!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Textract!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-textract) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon Textract. In this [Hello, Cloud](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-cloud) blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon Textract and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program to extract text from documents and images. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. If you've never worked with serverless, prepare to have your mind blown.

## Our Hello, Textract Project

Weâ€™re going to first try out Textract through the AWS console. Then, we'll create a .NET 6 console program and use it to command Textract to process a variety of documents and display the text and data found. We'll feed Textract forms, IDs, photographs, scanned handwriting, documents, and tables to test its abilities.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
